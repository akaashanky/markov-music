# Experiments in Overtone

Something I wrote for a hackathon at work using [Overtone](https://github.com/overtone/overtone)

This is basically Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes transcribed into code and played out using Overtone's sampled-piano instrument. Used some very interesting utilities offered by Overtone for a function that algorithmically generates a lead section based on the key of the song.
